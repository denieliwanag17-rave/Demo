    <h1>The Best Movie According To Denie</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movie of all-time</h2>
     <hr/>

     <h3>Howl’s Moving Castle</h3>
     <p>
    I love the quirky magic and how emotional the story is without being over the top.
     </p>
     <h3>My Neighbor Totoro</h3>
     <p>
      It’s just pure joy and nostalgia; it makes me feel like a kid again.  
     </p>
    <h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
    <p>
      The way it shows the struggle between nature and humans is so intense and beautiful.
