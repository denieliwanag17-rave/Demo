<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’m a beginner web developer, just starting my journey into the exciting world
  of coding and building websites. Every day, I dive into learning HTML, CSS,
  and JavaScript, experimenting with small projects and challenges to better
  understand how the web works. While I may be at the start of my journey, I am
  passionate about creating websites that are not only functional but also
  visually appealing and user-friendly. I enjoy solving problems and figuring
  out how to make designs come to life through code, even when it takes time and
  patience to get things just right. I understand that learning web development
  is a process full of trial and error, debugging, and constant discovery, and I
  embrace every challenge as an opportunity to improve. Each line of code I
  write feels like a step forward, building my confidence and helping me gain
  skills that will grow stronger with practice. I am eager to keep learning,
  experimenting, and eventually contribute to meaningful projects, knowing that
  every expert developer started as a beginner like me. My curiosity,
  persistence, and willingness to learn fuel my journey, and I am excited to see
  where this path in web development will take me.
